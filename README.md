# Credit-risk-analysis
This project is an analysis of the credit status of individuals across different age groups and predicting the likelyhood of someone being default listed or being a non-defaulter. The project starts off by doing exploratory analysis of the data. It breaks the data down into 3 buckets which is done by age for further analysis. Finally Linear regression and random tree forest are used to predict the probability of default.
